*Psst — looking for a more complete solution? Check out [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), the official framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.*

*Looking for a shareable component template instead? You can [use SvelteKit for that as well](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#packaging) or the older [sveltejs/component-template](https://github.com/sveltejs/component-template)*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd crossword
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
yarn install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
vercel deploy --name crossword
```

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
yarn install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
yarn run build
surge public crossword.surge.sh
```
